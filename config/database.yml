# Note: The database defined as "test" will be erased and re-generated from your
# development database when you run "rake". Do not set this db to the same as 
# development or production.

# Remember: Never store sensitive information, like your database password, in 
# your source code. If your source code is ever seen by anyone, they now have 
# access to your database. Instead, provide the password or a full connection 
# URL as an environment variable when you boot the app.

# Read https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database for
# a full overview on how database connection configuration can be specified.
