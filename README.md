<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project aims to create an online enrollment registration website for The Learning Source (TLS), an organization committed to empowering students through education. The primary goal is to streamline the enrollment process for prospective students, based on staff insights and feedback.

Our web application harnesses React for frontend and Ruby on Rails for backend within a unique monolithic setup. We leverage HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Ruby, and PostgreSQL alongside Vite.js for a streamlined development experience. The design workflow is managed through GitHub Issues and documented using Google Docs.

To ensure high quality, we employ a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach using RSpec for unit tests, and Capybara, Selenium, and ChromeDriver for feature testing and cross-browser compatibility checks.

For our DevOps processes, we use Render and GitHub to maintain a smooth and reliable release pipeline. This project is an opportunity for us to explore the combination of Rails and React.js, enhance our understanding of TDD, and optimize our DevOps practices.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This section provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run this project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have installed [Chrome Driver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/). This is needed for the selenium webdriver gem to function, allowing RSpec and Capybara to run JavaScript correctly and test the webpage contents.

For macOS users:

1. Install Chrome Driver using Homebrew: `brew install --cask chromedriver`.
2. Confirm installation by running `chromedriver -v`.

> **Note:** In case Chrome Driver is quarantined by macOS:
> 1. Run `which chromedriver` to find the installation path. The output should look similar to `/usr/local/bin/chromedriver`.
> 2. Run `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/chromedriver`.
> 3. Confirm it's working by repeating step 2 above.

### Installation

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. In your console or terminal, navigate to the project directory and run `bundle install`.
3. Run `bundle exec vite install`.
4. Run `npm install`.

### Usage

#### To use the repository

*Instructions to be added*

#### To run tests

You will need two terminal windows (or tabs):

1. **Terminal 1:** Navigate to the project directory and start the Vite server with `npm run dev`. This command starts the Vite server, which the tests will interact with. Ensure that the Vite server is always running in the background while executing the tests.

2. **Terminal 2:** Navigate to the project directory and run `bundle exec rspec` to run the entire RSpec test suite. The test results will be output in this terminal window.

<!-- Repository Installation -->
### Repository Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/msakr21/registration`
1. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory: `cd triple_crown`
1. Install gem packages: `bundle install`
1. Setup the database: `rails db:{create,migrate,seed}`
1. Run local RSpec test suite, all tests should be passing: `bundle exec rspec`
1. Start the server: `rails s`
1. Open your web browser and navigate to `localhost:3000`. You should now see the Triple Crown Reference application running locally on your machine.
